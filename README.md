## Description
This is my second Python project from the CS50P course. The program prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods). This project mainly increased my abilities in researching Python documentation.

## Learning Outcomes
- Developing the ability to use Python string methods
- Developing the ability to read Python documentation

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your computer
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing "playback.py". For example, if you cloned the repo:
```bash
cd name-of-repo-folder
python playback.py
```

### Type your input and press Enter. The program puts 3 dots in place of spaces.
